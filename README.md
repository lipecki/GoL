An implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in Java.

Please note that if you are looking for a beautiful rendering of the game you will be greatly underwhelmed:
the program outputs updates to the grid universe as arrays of boolean values to the console 
where true indicates a live cell and false indicates a dead cell.
